            <h2>About me.</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Sam. Growing up, I was always around computers but didn't consider to work with them for a career.
                My childhood dream was to be a pilot but then I saw a movie in which people could use computers to access the human mind.
                As a result, I became interested in computers as a way to help people in many ways, neurologically. It may be a far-fetched fantasy,
                but I hope one day I can advance technology further in a way to allow computers to visualize and display human thoughts  and dreams.
