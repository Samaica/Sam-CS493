        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Data structuring using structured variables, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees; recursive procedures; applications to sorting and merging. The class emphasizes theoretical understanding of data structures, their implementation, and the object-oriented viewpoint. Assignments will contain significant programming projects along with programming-free questions that explore how data structures work.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>CS 172, MATH 141 OR MATH 225 </p>
